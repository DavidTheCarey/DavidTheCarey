Software engineer with a background in Game Design where I honed my skills in developing efficient code that is sustainable overtime while also creating simplified elegant designs.. In my previous career, I worked closely with a team of passionate people to provide great customer service and enter customer data effectively. Working there helped me understand how to ensure a customer’s needs are met and how to build long-lasting business (and personal) relationships. My compassion and communication skills are invaluable to any team’s dynamic or conversation with a customer. I want to bring my drive, natural affinity to programming, and positive attitude to a workplace I can reinvigorate and optimize.
